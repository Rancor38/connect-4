# Connect-4

Connect-4 is a classic two-player board game where the objective is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

This project provides a simple implementation of the Connect-4 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns clicking on slots to place their colored discs on a 6x7 game board. The game automatically checks for a win condition after each move and declares the winner when four discs of the same color are connected. The game can be reset to play again.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the game board and includes necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the game board.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and handles user interactions.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files and place them in a directory on your computer.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The Connect-4 game will be displayed on the screen.
4. Take turns with another player by clicking on the slots to place your colored discs.
5. The game will automatically check for a win condition after each move and display a message if a player wins.
6. To reset the game and start again, click the "Reset" button.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game or extend its functionality, you can modify the following files:

- `index.html`: You can modify the structure and layout of the game board by editing the HTML code.
- `style.css`: You can change the styles and appearance of the game board by modifying the CSS code.
- `main.js`: You can modify the game logic and behavior by editing the JavaScript code. You can add additional features or customize the win condition rules.
